# Learning About Linux

## Introduction
In this document, I will be summarizing what I have learned about Linux, including its history, the various distributions available, and some basic Linux commands that are commonly used.

## Section 1: Linux History
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a free and open-source operating system. It began as a small project, but it quickly grew in popularity due to its stability, security, and flexibility. Today, Linux powers everything from personal computers to the majority of the world's servers.

## Section 2: Linux Distributions
A Linux distribution, or distro, is a version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel along with additional software. Some of the most popular Linux distributions include:
- **Ubuntu**: Known for its user-friendliness and large community support.

## Section 3: Basic Linux Commands
Here are some basic commands I've learned:
- `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.

## Conclusion
Linux is an essential tool for anyone working in tech, especially in areas like servers, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. Its flexibility and open-source nature make it a powerful operating system for a wide range of uses.
